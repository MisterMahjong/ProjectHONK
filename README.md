#ProjectHONK
Project Honk will change the face of gaming, forever. 

Notes: This project was created as a final for a programming for IT course. The module necessary to run
Clown Clicker Turbo is simply pygame.

Simply pull the repository and its files to your desired folder, and run the main file.
Runs on python 3.7.

Here's a link to the pygame documentation.

Big thanks to the youtube channel TheNewBoston's series of videos on Pygame.
These videos got me started and helped give me ideas on where to go next on my project.

This website also proved very handy when dealing with implementing clickable hitboxes.
